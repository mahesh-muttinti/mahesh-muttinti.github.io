## Full Stack Web Development

### There are several stacks to Full stack development

#### Let me consider MERN Stack because i choose that Stack for Web Development

# MERN Stack refers to:

- **M** For MongoDB
- **E** For Express Js
- **R** For React Js
- **N** For Node Js

In any Full Stack Development is a combination of **Front-End Development** and **Back-End Development**

## Front-End Development

Front-End Development is nothing but what the user can see on website or web application.

In Front-End, we should use:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Bootstrap
5. React JS

## Back-End Development

Back-End Development is totally server side programming to handle the data from the user and get and post the data from database.

In Back-End, we should use:

1. Node Js
2. Express Js
3. MongoDB
